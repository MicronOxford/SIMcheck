SIMcheck
========

SIMcheck is a package of ImageJ tools for assessing the quality and
reliability of Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM) data.

* More information can be found on the 
[Micron Oxford Website](http://www.micron.ox.ac.uk/software/SIMCheck.shtml)
* **The latest .jar can be downloaded from
[here](http://www.micron.ox.ac.uk/microngroup/software/SIMcheck_.jar)**
* Further help is available
[here](http://www.micron.ox.ac.uk/microngroup/software/SIMcheck.html)

The code is arranged in a conventional Maven-like structure and includes
an ant build script that can copy the resulting SIMcheck_.jar to a local
plugin folder. Before building the project, first make a ./lib/ directory 
containing a soft link to the ij.jar from the desired ImageJ version,
as well as a soft link to junit.jar. The built result will be copied
to ./plugins/ so soft-link this to your ImageJ plugins folder. Type "ant"
to build the default (all) target and restart ImageJ or Help->Refresh Menus

Style Notes
===========

* simple, modular structure - each check is a standalone plugin
* exec methods take input images and return ResulSet with no GUI calls
* no dependencies other than ImageJ1
* ImageJ1-like preference for pre- java 5 features (i.e. not many generics)
  and reliance on float primitive type for most calculations


TODO
====

* 1.0: integration/GUI, tests, documentation & write-up up for release
      - option for per-angle profiles for SIR Fourier FFT (specified K0 values)
        - store k0 values? k0 values in degrees?
      - improve log output & names: should be simple, concise & self-explanatory
        - MCNR: change name of "Z window half-width"
        - MCNR: what does "raw Fourier" option do?
      - modify raw MCNR default Z window half-width to 0 where nz=1
      - Wiener filter parameter estimate - document, calibrate
      - SIR Histogram: extreme X% instead of 0.05%
      - document need for cropping & offer a solution (a utility)
      - paper & public web page with EXAMPLES
      - mavenize & make Fiji update site
      - finish & refactor Cal_Phases: unwrap (+test case), stats and structure
      - discard negatives macro / utility
      - bead puddle SI illumination image
        split angles, de-interleave 5 phases, rotate to orthogonal
      - add ResultTable support to ResultSet class
      - color from channel metadata?
      - raw -> WF same size as SIR by interpolation (& preserve type??)
        - Julio: tool for merging SIM & widefield data
      - convert dialog & logging to non-blocking swing GUI
      - check preconditions & robustness w.r.t. input data (multi-d, type etc.)
      - more junit tests to test/debug non-interactive code
      - make sure tests and debug not deployed
      - final empirical tests, param calibration, tolerances etc.
      - raw data per angle difference: RMS error? (at least some stat)
      - SIR_hist with multiple frames
      - SIR_FFT, try Rainer's window function
      - util for rescaling as per Lothar_macros

* 1.1: future features
      - pre: add statistic for floaty / uneven illumination detection
      - post: k0 angle lines (manual entry?), resolution, symmetrical /angle?
      - post: SIR FFT automatic resolution estimation??
      - pre: FFT check to estimate angles & line-spacing
      - cali: PSF symmetry within tolerance?
      - cali: OTF extent, shape & order separation?


SIM Reconstruction Problems & Remedies 
--------------------------------------
(Kai Wicker)

- **Camera background**: subtraction

- **optical distortions & uneven gain**: flat-field correction

- **illumination intensity fluctuations**: normalisation (after background subtraction)

- **sample drift between images**: drift correction by means of cross-correlation

- **unknown grating period**: find grating vector using component cross-correlations

- **fluctuations in grating phase**: optimization of mixing matrix

- **fluctuation of order strengths between images**

- **sample drift between focal slices**: drift correction through cross-correlation

- **unknown zero grating phase**: global phase via cross-correlation

- **drift between rotational orientations**: drift correction through cross-correlation

- **unknown order strengths**: compare different separated components
