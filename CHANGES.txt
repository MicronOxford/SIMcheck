Version 0.8
-----------
* significant speed-up of mod contrast calc
* fixed several problems with reconstructed Fourier plots
* improved Fourier plots (window function, calibration)
* fixed mod contrast map display scaling
* ELYRA data conversion from main dialog now works
* better log info - tidied output, preparation for GUI

Version 0.9
-----------
* SI "Z variation" plugin now normalized to average values
  in the image, making it more robust
* Modulation contrast calculation improved / fixed,
** so it is valid at different noise levels 
** uses illumination pattern orders 1 and 2 instead of 1
** a noticeable effect is that typical mod contrast values 
   are halved
* intensity histogram and mismatch plugins produce stacks
* reconstructed Fourier check produces a radial profile plot
* phase calibration plugin improved,
** detects peaks from pattern order 1 and plots them
** estimates line spacing and k angle from the peaks
** produces result table for phase step analysis
* new N-SIM format converter

Version 0.9.5
-------------
* new SIMcheck Manual (using the Sphinx documentation tool)
* fixes to Phase Step calibration check (Ian Dobbie)
* switched to Apache Maven for build & dependency management
* reconstructed Fourier Plots streamlined and improved
* many of the checks have been renamed
* fixed bug in Reconstructed Intensity Histogram statistic
* code tidied and more tests added, several minor bugs fixed
* Modulation Contrast Map shows saturation in raw data (green)
* new Illumination Pattern Focus calibration check
* new Threshold and 16-bit Conversion utility
* raw data Fourier plugin now displays montage of projections
* fixes to ELYRA and N-SIM data format conversion
* implemented image-cropping utility in main SIMcheck dialog
* added option to specify camera bit depth (to identify saturation)
* Look-Up Tables displayed as overlay on results when appropriate
* the log output / report generation has been tidied up

Version 0.9.6
-------------
* new Result Table summarising key numerical stats and interpretation
* RMSE stat for MIV check implementation finished
* CIP changed to report overall intensity fluctuation statistic
