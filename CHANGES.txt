Version 0.8
-----------
* significant speed-up of mod contrast calc
* fixed several problems with SIR_Fourier plot
* improved Fourier plots (window function, calibration)
* fixed mod contrast map display scaling
* ELYRA data conversion from main dialog now works
* better log info - tidied output, preparation for GUI

Version 0.9
-----------
* SI "Z variation" plugin now normalized to average values
  in the image, making it more robust
* Modulation contrast calculation improved / fixed,
** so it is valid at different noise levels 
** uses illumination pattern orders 1 and 2 instead of 1
** a noticeable effect is that typical mod contrast values 
   are halved
* SIR histogram and Z variation plugins produce stacks
* SIR Fourier check produces a radial profile plot
* phase calibration plugin improved,
** detects peaks from pattern order 1 and plots them
** estimates line spacing and k angle from the peaks
** produces result table for phase step analysis
* new N-SIM format converter
